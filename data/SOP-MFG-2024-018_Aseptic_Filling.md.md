            - Connect sterile transfer tubing
            - Verify closed system integrity
            - Prime filling lines (discard first 500 mL to waste container)
            - Check for air bubbles (must be removed)
    
    Step 3: Set filling parameters
            - Target fill volume: __________ mL (as per BPR)
            - Filling speed: 180-220 vials/minute
            - Needle descent depth: 40 mm from vial mouth
            - Stopper insertion force: 25-35 N
    
    Step 4: Process first 3 units

    IF particle count exceeds Grade A limit:
        → STOP filling operation
        → Quarantine all units filled in past 15 minutes
        → Investigate source (personnel, material, equipment)
        → Re-clean area and re-qualify environment
        → Document in Deviation Report
        → Resume only after investigation complete and corrective action taken
    
    IF fill weight consistently out of specification (>3 consecutive units):
        → STOP machine
        → Check pump calibration
        → Adjust flow rate or machine settings
        → Perform 10 test fills to verify correction
