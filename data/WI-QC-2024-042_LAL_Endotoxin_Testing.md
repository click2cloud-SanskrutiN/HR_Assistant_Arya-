1. PURPOSE
================================================================================
This work instruction provides detailed step-by-step guidance for performing 
endotoxin testing on vaccine bulk and finished products using the Limulus 
Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) kinetic chromogenic method.

================================================================================
2. SCOPE
================================================================================
Applicable to all injectable vaccine products requiring endotoxin testing as 
per product specifications and pharmacopeial requirements (USP <85>, Ph. Eur 
2.6.14).

Testing performed on:
- Bulk vaccine solutions (pre-filling)
- Finished vaccine products (post-filling)
- Water for Injection (WFI)
- Process water samples

================================================================================
3. PRINCIPLE
================================================================================
Bacterial endotoxins catalyze the activation of a proenzyme in LAL reagent. 
The activated enzyme catalyzes the splitting of a chromogenic substrate, 
releasing p-nitroaniline (pNA), which is measured spectrophotometrically at 
405 nm. The reaction time (onset time) is inversely proportional to endotoxin 
concentration.

================================================================================
4. RESPONSIBILITIES
================================================================================
QC Analyst: Execute testing, record results, report out-of-specification
QC Supervisor: Review data, approve/reject results, investigate OOS
QC Manager: Final approval of batch release testing

================================================================================
5. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
================================================================================
- Wear lab coat, safety goggles, and gloves at all times
- Handle endotoxin standards as biohazards
- Depyrogenate all glassware before use (250°C for 2 hours minimum)
- Never use non-depyrogenated items (causes false positive)
- Work in laminar flow hood (ISO Class 5) to prevent contamination
- Discard contaminated materials in biohazard waste

7.1.2 Reagent Preparation
    
    CRITICAL: All dilutions must be prepared in depyrogenated glassware
              using LAL Reagent Water (LRW) only.
    
    Step 1: Prepare Control Standard Endotoxin (CSE) Stock Solution
            
            CSE vial label potency: _________ EU/vial
            
            Calculate reconstitution volume:
            Volume (mL) = [Potency on vial (EU)] / [Desired concentration]
            
            For 50 EU/mL stock:
            Volume = [Potency] / 50
            
            Example: If vial = 500 EU
            Volume = 500 / 50 = 10.0 mL LRW
            
            a) Remove CSE vial from refrigerator (2-8°C)
            b) Allow to reach room temperature (15 minutes)
            c) Add calculated volume of LRW
            d) Cap vial and vortex gently for 30 seconds
            e) Let stand 15 minutes to ensure complete dissolution
            f) Label: "CSE Stock, 50 EU/mL, Date, Analyst initials"
            g) Use immediately or store at 2-8°C (stable 2 weeks)
    
    Step 2: Prepare CSE Working Solutions (Standard Curve)
            
            Required concentrations: 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.05 EU/mL
            
            Using serial dilution from 50 EU/mL stock:
            
            Dilution 1: 0.5 EU/mL
            - Add 0.1 mL stock (50 EU/mL) + 9.9 mL LRW
            - Vortex 15 seconds
            
            Dilution 2: 0.25 EU/mL
            - Add 5.0 mL of 0.5 EU/mL + 5.0 mL LRW
            - Vortex 15 seconds
            
            Dilution 3: 0.125 EU/mL
            - Add 5.0 mL of 0.25 EU/mL + 5.0 mL LRW
            - Vortex 15 seconds
            
            Dilution 4: 0.05 EU/mL
            - Add 2.0 mL of 0.125 EU/mL + 3.0 mL LRW
            - Vortex 15 seconds
            
            IMPORTANT: Prepare fresh working solutions daily.
                       Do not store diluted standards.
    
    Step 3: Reconstitute LAL Reagent
            
            a) Remove LAL vial from refrigerator
            b) Allow to reach room temperature (15 minutes)
            c) Add volume of LRW as specified on vial label
               (typically 5.2 mL for Kinetic-QCL)
            d) Swirl gently (DO NOT VORTEX - damages lysate)
            e) Let stand 10 minutes
            f) Swirl again gently
            g) Use within 4 hours of reconstitution
    
    Step 4: Reconstitute Chromogenic Substrate
            
            a) Add specified volume LRW per vial label
            b) Swirl gently until dissolved
            c) Use within 4 hours

7.1.3 Sample Preparation
    
    Step 1: Retrieve samples from refrigerator
            - Record sample ID, batch number, description
            - Allow to reach room temperature (20-25°C)
            - Visually inspect (clarity, color, no visible particles)
    
    Step 2: Determine sample dilution
            
            Required dilution based on:
            a) Product specification for endotoxin limit
            b) Maximum Valid Dilution (MVD)
            
            MVD = (Endotoxin Limit × Sample Concentration) / λ
            
            Where:
            - Endotoxin Limit = specification (EU/mL or EU/dose)
            - Sample Concentration = product concentration
            - λ = labeled sensitivity of LAL reagent (0.005 EU/mL)
            
            Example for Vaccine Product:
            Specification: < 2.5 EU/dose
            Dose volume: 0.5 mL
            
            MVD = (2.5 EU/dose × 1 dose/0.5 mL) / 0.005 EU/mL
            MVD = 5.0 / 0.005 = 1000-fold
            
            Typical testing dilution: 1:10 or 1:100
            (Must be ≤ MVD)
    
    Step 3: Prepare sample dilutions in depyrogenated tubes
            
            For 1:10 dilution:
            - Add 0.5 mL sample + 4.5 mL LRW
            - Cap and vortex 10 seconds
            
            For 1:100 dilution:
            - From 1:10, take 0.5 mL + 4.5 mL LRW
            - Cap and vortex 10 seconds
    
    Step 4: Perform pH check (Critical for accuracy)
            
            LAL reaction is pH-sensitive (optimal pH 6.0-8.0)
            
            - Place 1 drop of diluted sample on pH paper
            - Compare to color chart
            - Acceptable range: pH 6-8
            
            IF pH outside range:
            → Adjust using 0.1 N HCl or 0.1 N NaOH
            → Re-check pH
            → Document adjustment in test record

7.2 TESTING PHASE

7.2.1 Test Setup Layout
    
    Prepare test tubes in the following order:
    (Each test = duplicate tubes, 100 μL per tube)
    
    Row 1: Negative Control (LRW only) - 2 tubes
    Row 2: Positive Product Control (PPC) - 2 tubes
            Sample (at chosen dilution) + CSE (0.25 EU/mL spike)
    Row 3: Standard 1 (0.5 EU/mL) - 2 tubes
    Row 4: Standard 2 (0.25 EU/mL) - 2 tubes
    Row 5: Standard 3 (0.125 EU/mL) - 2 tubes
    Row 6: Standard 4 (0.05 EU/mL) - 2 tubes
    Row 7: Sample dilution 1:10 - 2 tubes
    Row 8: Sample dilution 1:100 - 2 tubes
    
    Total tubes = 16

7.2.2 Sample Loading
    
    Work in laminar flow hood throughout.
    
    Step 1: Label all depyrogenated tubes
            - Use waterproof marker
            - Label: NC, PPC, S1-S4, Sample ID
    
    Step 2: Pipette 100 μL into each tube:
            
            Tubes 1-2: 100 μL LRW (Negative Control)
            Tubes 3-4: 100 μL sample + 100 μL CSE 0.5 EU/mL (PPC)
                      Final spike = 0.25 EU/mL
            Tubes 5-6: 100 μL CSE 0.5 EU/mL (Standard 1)
            Tubes 7-8: 100 μL CSE 0.25 EU/mL (Standard 2)
            Tubes 9-10: 100 μL CSE 0.125 EU/mL (Standard 3)
            Tubes 11-12: 100 μL CSE 0.05 EU/mL (Standard 4)
            Tubes 13-14: 100 μL Sample (1:10 dilution)
            Tubes 15-16: 100 μL Sample (1:100 dilution)
    
    Step 3: Pre-incubate loaded tubes
            - Place all tubes in heating block at 37°C
            - Incubate exactly 10 minutes (set timer)
            - This equilibrates temperature

7.2.3 LAL Reagent Addition & Reading
    
    Step 1: Add LAL reagent
            - After 10-minute pre-incubation
            - Working quickly but carefully:
            - Add 100 μL reconstituted LAL to EACH tube
            - Use 8-channel pipette if available for speed
            - Mix by gently aspirating 3 times
            - Timing is critical - complete within 2 minutes
    
    Step 2: Immediately transfer to LAL reader
            - Place tubes in reader cartridge
            - Ensure proper positioning (check reader display)
            - Close lid
    
    Step 3: Start kinetic reading
            - Select program: "Kinetic Chromogenic"
            - Reading parameters:
              Temperature: 37 ± 1°C
              Wavelength: 405 nm
              Reading interval: 30 seconds
              Total duration: 150 minutes (or until all complete)
            - Click "START"
            - Reader will:
              a) Shake cartridge 3 seconds
              b) Add substrate automatically (if auto-dispense)
              c) Read absorbance every 30 seconds
              d) Calculate onset time for each tube

7.3 DATA ANALYSIS

7.3.1 Automated Calculations (Performed by LAL Reader Software)
    
    Step 1: Standard curve generation
            - Software plots log(endotoxin concentration) vs log(onset time)
            - Linear regression calculates slope and intercept
            - Displays correlation coefficient (r)
    
    Step 2: Sample endotoxin calculation
            - Software reads sample onset time
            - Calculates endotoxin using standard curve equation
            - Accounts for dilution factor
            - Reports final result in EU/mL or EU/dose

7.3.2 Data Review & Acceptance Criteria
    
    Step 1: Check Negative Control
            ✓ No reaction (onset time > 150 minutes or "No Reaction")
            ✗ If positive: Test invalid, investigate contamination
    
    Step 2: Check Standard Curve
            ✓ Correlation coefficient (r): ≥ 0.980
            ✓ All standards within ± 2 SD of regression line
            ✗ If fails: Repeat test with fresh reagents
    
    Step 3: Check Positive Product Control (PPC)
            
            Calculate % Recovery:
            % Recovery = (Measured spike / Expected spike) × 100
            
            Expected spike = 0.25 EU/mL (or 0.125 after LAL addition)
            
            ✓ Acceptable range: 50-200% recovery
            
            This confirms:
            - Product does not inhibit LAL reaction
            - Product does not enhance LAL reaction
            
            ✗ If outside range: Product may interfere
               → Increase dilution and re-test
    
    Step 4: Check Sample Replicates
            ✓ Coefficient of variation (CV) between duplicates: ≤ 25%
            
            CV = (SD / Mean) × 100
            
            ✗ If CV > 25%: Poor precision, repeat test
    
    Step 5: Verify Result vs Specification
            
            Calculate final endotoxin content:
            
            Result (EU/mL) = [Measured value] × [Dilution factor]
            
            or
            
            Result (EU/dose) = [Result in EU/mL] × [Dose volume in mL]
            
            Example:
            Measured: 0.02 EU/mL at 1:10 dilution
            Result: 0.02 × 10 = 0.2 EU/mL in original sample
            
            If dose = 0.5 mL:
            Result = 0.2 × 0.5 = 0.1 EU/dose
            
            Compare to specification:
            ✓ If < limit: PASS
            ✗ If ≥ limit: FAIL (Out-of-Specification)
